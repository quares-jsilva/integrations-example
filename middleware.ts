 * This TypeScript function is a middleware that checks if a session exists and redirects to a login

 * @param {NextRequest} req - The `req` parameter is the request object that contains information about
 * the incoming HTTP request. It includes properties such as the request method, headers, URL, and
 * query parameters. It is used to extract information from the request and perform operations based on
 * that information.
 * @returns The code is returning a NextResponse object. If the session is not found, it redirects to
 * the login page with the requested page as a query parameter. If the session is found, it allows the
 * request to proceed to the next middleware or route handler.
